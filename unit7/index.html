    <h2> Step 1: Reflection</h2>

    <h3> Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/"> airbnb</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="http://colectivocoffee.com/"> Collectivo Coffe </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="https://jenis.com/"> Jenis Ice Cream </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.davekellerportfolio.com/"> This Dudes Portfolio</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="http://portfolio.nacho.io/"> This Dudes Portfolio</a> </li>
    </ul> 

   <h3>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3>
    <p> Pretty happy with the overall clean style & the typeface choices</p>

   <h3>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3>
    <p>Sometimes there are just so many ideas it’s really  hard not to want to switch in the middle.<br> If you don’t stick with the direction you picked and move forward you’ll never finish - and probably end up throwing your computer out the window…</p>

   <h3>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h3>
    <p>I still think floats are evil! Also had some issues with image size and placement</p>

   <h3>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h3>
    <p>This is so important when it comes to the use of cross device interaction <br> Using % and em to stay sane</p>

     <h2> Step 2: Reviews</h2>

      <h3> Group 1: <a href="http://www.businessoffashion.com"> Business of Fashion</a> </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first clicked on this site I was a little overwhelmed. So.much.is.happening. Then I thought more about what the objectives are for this site, the name, what they’re trying to convey… and it started to make sense....  BUSINESS of Fashion, ooh okay. So it was intentional to design this site look similar to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/"> Reuters</a> or <a href="http://www.cnbc.com"> CNBC News </a> or any other business-y news-y (booooring) site out there. Got it. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As layout and flow, once you get past the fact this isnt a beautiful fashion-photography site with vibrant colors and high resolution photos of women wearing thousands of dollars worth of fabrics… You can start to appreciate the site for what it is, or intends to be. Of course there is a business side to fashion, and that culture deserves a website too.  I think the site might benefit from adding some more negative space, just to break things up a little bit. Currently there is a lot of information all crammed up against each other. A slight readjustment of some spacing would allow a user to grasp the content and navigate through the site with more ease. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The logo is great, it reminds me of The NY Times, or WSJ, or any highly-respected news-source. I this it’s very smart. If I am not mistaken, all the copy on this site is serif (with exception of incredibly small Author & Date), which I would normally call out as a no-no. But there is enough variance in the weight, size, style, letter-spacing, even Smallcaps, that I think it works. Now I am not saying the site wouldn’t benefit from some sans-serif to mix it up, but considering the overall objective of the site, it’s at the very least not offensive.</p>

    <h3> Group 2: <a href="http://cavs.mit.edu/"> Center for Advanced Visual Studies</a> </h3>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously have to question if this is a joke or not? How can this site’s headline read “Center for Advanced Visual Arts”? This is one of the most stressful, anxiety-provoking, disorganized websites I have ever visited. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout is a mess, they clearly forgot to use the rule of thirds, or the golden mean - or any design rule for that matter. There is no sense of spatial placement.  I have no idea what I am supposed to give my attention to. Every single design principle is broken or non existent, and not in a cool ironic way; but in a frustrating spiraling-out-of-control way. There is no focal point, my eyes have zero direction. I’m sorry, but this page has an intense case of A.D.D. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typography looks like no effort was put into it, generic default-mode.  There is no variance in text, it is all a sans serif, and with the exception of the “headline”, obnoxiously small. What is that font size 7pt? 5pt? Its a good thing I have no interest in actually reading any of this copy… <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigation? What navigation? it is literally non-existent until you hover over the “go to” text in the top left corner. This is the complete opposite of intuitive.   <br> 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, okay, I realize this is an incredibly negative critique, but this is an incredibly bad website.</p>
